## Overview

This project, which is built with Beamable, primarily demonstrates Federated Inventory 
inconjunction with Generative AI (OpenAI and Scenario.com) to dynamically produce Content. 

A custom C# Microservice, developed and deployed to Beamable's backend from within Unity, 
is used to provide custom APIs to the AI Forge game client, so that it may request new sword content be created.

## Project Structure

`Assets/Game` - Game client code  
`Assets/Beamable/Microservices` - Microservice and managed storage code  
`Assets/Beamable/Autogenerated` - Auto-generated microservice client code  
`Assets/Beamable/Microservices/AIMicroservice/Configuration.cs` - This file **must** be updated with your own OpenAI and Scenario.com API keys
in order for this project to work. See a preview of the file below:  

```
namespace Beamable.Microservices
{
    internal class Configuration
    {
        // todo put that into realm config and read it from there
        public const string OpenAiApiKey = "OpenAI key needed"; // OpenAI.com API key
        public const string ScenarioApiKey = "Scenario key needed"; // Scenario.com API key
    }
}
```
